Marcolian: Situated on Mars, the Marcolians are a militaristic and technologically advanced society. They focus on mechanical prowess and strategic warfare.
Augencore: These nomadic people have made the asteroid belt their home. They rely heavily on mechanical modifications and are known for their adaptability.

## Gameplay Mechanics

In Parallel, players construct decks that represent one of these Parallels and engage in 1v1 turn-based battles. The game involves a variety of card types:

Units: These are your main combatants on the field. Units have specific stats and abilities that make them unique.
Effects: These cards trigger powerful abilities that can change the tide of battle. They are usually one-time use.
Relics: These cards provide passive influences on the game and are crucial for long-term strategies.
Upgrades: These cards enhance Units, providing them with additional stats or abilities.
Players start with 30 Health Points (HP), and the objective is to reduce the opponent's HP to zero.

## Deck Construction

A deck in Parallel must consist of 40 cards. These cards must either belong to a single Parallel or be Universal cards that can be used by any Parallel. Each deck also features a Paragon, a leader card that provides both passive and active abilities to the player.

## Energy and Banking

Summary: This section explains the concept of Energy (Mana resources) and how it is used in the game. It is meant to provide a basic understanding of the Energy system.
Energy is the resource you use to play cards. You gain Energy by "banking" cards during your turn. Each banked card provides one unit of Energy, which is refilled at the start of your turn.

## Objectives and Winning Conditions

Summary: This section explains the primary objective of the game and how to win. It is meant to provide a basic understanding of the game's win conditions.
The primary goal in Parallel is straightforward: reduce your opponent's HP to zero. However, the game also involves various strategic elements like controlling the field with Units, targeting specific enemy Units, and creating synergies between different types of cards.

## Order of Play

## Start of the Game

Summary: This section explains the process of starting a match. It is meant to provide a basic understanding of the game's starting mechanics.
At the beginning of each match, it is randomly decided which player will go first. Both players are then shown 5 random cards from their own deck. They can choose to return any number of those cards to their deck and draw that many cards to replace them. This phase is known as the Mulligan phase, and it's crucial for setting up your initial strategy.

## Turn Mechanics

Summary: This section explains the process of taking a turn. It is meant to provide a basic understanding of the game's turn mechanics.
During each player's turn, a card is drawn and added to their hand. Players can have a maximum of 8 cards in their hand. If you attempt to draw a card while having a full 8-card hand, the new card will be revealed to both players and immediately placed in the Waste Pile. Energy can be spent to play cards onto the field, perform actions, and command Units to engage in combat.

## Combat Mechanics

Summary: This section explains the process of combat. It is meant to provide a basic understanding of the game's combat mechanics.
New Units placed on the field will suffer from Fatigue, preventing them from attacking on the turn they are played. However, on subsequent turns, those Units can engage in combat. Combat in Parallel is resolved simultaneously, meaning if both Units can deal lethal damage to each other, they will both be destroyed.

## Running Out of Cards

Summary: This section explains what happens when a player runs out of cards
If a player's deck is empty, they can still draw cards from their Waste Pile but will lose an exponential amount of Health, starting at 1 and doubling with each additional card drawn. This is known as Searching the Waste.

## Glossary and Keywords

Enemy: This term refers to the opposing player you are facing in the match.
Paragon: This is the leader card of your deck. It provides both passive and active abilities that can significantly influence the game.
Passive: These are abilities that are always active as long as the conditions are met. For example, a Paragon's passive ability is always in effect.
Bank: This is the act of putting a card into your Energy Bank, which will provide you with one Energy at the start of your next turn.
Waste: This is your discard pile. Cards that are used up or Units that are destroyed go here.

## Game Field Areas

Summary: This section provides a list of the different areas of the game field. It is meant to provide a basic understanding of the game's field areas.

Bank/Energy Bank: This is the area where you place your banked cards. These cards are face-down and provide you with Energy.
Energy: This is the resource you use to play cards. You gain Energy from your banked cards.
The Field: This is the main area where the game takes place. You place your Units, Relics, and Upgrades here.
Waste Pile: This is where your used or destroyed cards go. It's also the place you'll draw from if your deck is empty.
Card Types & Actions
Energy Cost: This is the amount of Energy required to play a card. It's usually displayed at the top right corner of the card.
Unit: This is a type of card that serves as your main combatant in the game. Units have stats like Attack and Health, and they can also have special abilities.
Stats: These are the numerical values that represent a Unit's Attack and Health. Attack determines how much damage a Unit can deal, while Health determines how much damage it can take.
Ability: These are special actions or effects that a card can perform. Abilities are usually written in the card's text box.
Keywords: These are special terms that are used to quickly convey a card's abilities. For example, a card with the "Flying" keyword would be able to avoid ground-based attacks.

## Special Keywords

Summary: This section provides a list of the different keywords used in the game. It is meant to provide a basic understanding of the game's keywords.

Armed: Units with this keyword deal their damage before non-Armed Units. This can be crucial for taking down powerful enemies before they have a chance to retaliate.
Assault: This keyword triggers a Unit's special ability if you've dealt damage to the enemy player this turn. It encourages aggressive playstyles.
Attuned: Units with this keyword change between two states at the start of your turn. This can add an extra layer of strategy, as you'll need to plan for how the Unit will behave on your next turn.
Battle Ready: Units with this keyword can attack on the same turn they are played, bypassing the usual Fatigue state. This is useful for quick, aggressive strategies.
Counter: Some cards use counters to track certain effects or conditions. For example, a Unit might gain a counter whenever it deals damage, and you can remove those counters to activate a powerful ability.
Decay: Units with this keyword deal 1 damage to themselves and adjacent Units at the start of your turn. This can be a double-edged sword, as it will weaken your own Units but can also be used to slowly whittle down enemy Units.
Defender: Units with this keyword can choose to block incoming attacks. This can protect your more valuable Units or your own Life total.
Evasive: Units with this keyword can't be blocked by Units with the Defender keyword. This makes them ideal for dealing damage directly to the enemy player.
Intel X: This keyword triggers a special ability if the enemy player has X or more revealed banked cards. It rewards you for keeping track of the enemy's resources.
Pacifist: Units with this keyword can't attack. They might have other useful abilities, but they won't be contributing to your offensive efforts.
Salvage X: When a Unit with this keyword is destroyed, you can move up to X of its attached Upgrades to other Units. This helps you maintain an advantage even when you lose a Unit.
Shielded: Units with this keyword are immune to the next enemy card effect that targets them. This can protect them from powerful removal spells or debilitating effects.
