# Echo Replication is now live

Replication is the process by which users can create Echo cards from their First Edition [FE], Special Edition [SE], or Perfect Loop [PL] cards.

## Important Details

-   Use $PRIME and in-game experience [Renown] to create new cards.
-   Replication involves spending both Prime and Renown [XP accrued per card based on usage] to create a new card called an Echo.
-   Echos are identical to other versions of cards in functionality within the game. There is no competitive advantage or disadvantage to using them.
-   Echos are NFTs and count as NFTs in-game.
-   Echos are represented as their own card category in-game and their own collection on trading marketplaces, separate from the Parallel Alpha collection [represented as EC]: [OpenSea Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/parallel-echos)
-   FE, SE, and PL versions of a given card all share dynamic replication pricing.
-   SE and PL cards both earn more Renown than their FE counterpart.
-   Renown earned per card is determined by which edition [FE/SE/PL] of a card you are using. Surge keys further amplify this.
-   Users who have $PRIME and a small amount of $ETH [for gas] on Base are able to Replicate.
-   Bridging $PRIME and $ETH to [@BuildonBase](https://twitter.com/BuildonBase) is required for Replicating.
-   Echos cannot be used for Replication.

## Cost to Replicate

The cost in Renown to Replicate is fixed at 800 Renown for all cards. The cost in Prime to Replicate is variable depending on current demand to Replicate.

> **Please note:** Details around Echos are subject to change.

## Conclusion

Players create cards using renown and $PRIME. The cost in $PRIME to do so changes with demand. The greater the demand to create, the higher the cost. The less the demand, the lower the cost.

We are excited to put the card economy in the hands of the players.
